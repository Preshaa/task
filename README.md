This repository contains two html pages which retrieve the http headers of the entered url.

This directory also contain one html, one css and one js file for showing a popup when we click on content.
(popup.html jquery_popup.js jquery_popup.css)

here, popup content should be mention in a class name popup. And content on whick click will be performed should be in a class name main.
